Unless you have direct exposure to groups like Deepmind, you have no idea how fast—it is growing at a pace close to exponential. The risk of something seriously dangerous happening is in the five-year timeframe. 10 years at most.”"
24,"Nick Bilton, tech columnist wrote in the New York Times","“The upheavals [of artificial intelligence] can escalate quickly and become scarier and even cataclysmic.
